<h1>SQL injection<h1> 
<h2>Description</h2>
<br>SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software by inserting malicious SQL queries into input fields. This can allow attackers to manipulate a database, gaining unauthorized access to data or executing administrative operations.
  Automated Tools and Scripts: Attackers increasingly use automated tools to scan for and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. Tools like SQLmap can automate the discovery and exploitation of SQL injection flaws.
